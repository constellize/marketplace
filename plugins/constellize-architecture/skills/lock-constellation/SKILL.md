description: Lock constellation scope and prevent feature creep
---

<task>
Lock the scope of $0 after constellation mapping and gap analysis to prevent feature creep and maintain implementation discipline.

A common trap when building from reusable parts is overextending: adding features just because the system is halfway there. The key is restraint—only build what closes the gap between your current stars and your goal. If a piece doesn't directly serve the needs uncovered during problem breakdown, it likely doesn't belong.

Follow this process:

1. **Review completed artifacts:**
   - Read constellation map at `construction/requirements/constellation-map.md`
   - Read gap analysis at `construction/requirements/gap-analysis.md`
   - Extract all documented stars
   - Extract all validated gaps

2. **Create scope lock document:**
   - List all approved features from gap analysis
   - Define governance process for new requests
   - Establish traceability rules
   - Document review criteria

3. **For each future feature request, enforce checklist:**
   - Does this feature exist in our gap list?
   - If not, has a new requirement been filed and reviewed?
   - Does the requirement trace back to stakeholder analysis?
   - Has the team approved expanding scope?

4. **Reject opportunistic features:**
   - Features "because we're already building X"
   - Features "because it would be easy to add"
   - Features without documented stakeholder need
   - Features that don't close a validated gap
</task>

<context>
**Standard Construction Folder Structure:**
This prompt reads from:
- `construction/requirements/constellation-map.md` (star catalog)
- `construction/requirements/gap-analysis.md` (identified gaps)

And outputs to: `construction/requirements/scope-lock.md` (scope governance)
</context>

<thinking>
Before locking scope, analyze:
1. Are all gaps in the PRD validated and traced to stakeholder needs?
2. What features might be tempting to add "while we're at it"?
3. How will we handle new feature requests that arise during implementation?
4. What process prevents scope creep without blocking legitimate requirements?
</thinking>

<output-format>
Format your output as `construction/requirements/scope-lock.md`:

# Scope Lock: $0

## Approved Scope

### Constellation Review
**Stars in Use:** [Count]

List of stars from `construction/requirements/constellation-map.md`:
- **[Star Name]**: [Capability]
- **[Star Name]**: [Capability]
- **[Star Name]**: [Capability]

### Approved Gaps to Build
**Total Gaps:** [Count] (from `construction/requirements/gap-analysis.md`)

For each gap from gap analysis:

#### Gap: [Gap Name]
**Priority:** [Critical/High/Medium/Low]
**Status:** 🟢 Approved for implementation
**Traceability:**
- Documented in: `construction/requirements/gap-analysis.md`
- Stakeholder need: [Reference to requirement]
- Success criteria: [Reference to measurable criteria]

## Governance Process

### New Feature Request Evaluation

When a new feature is proposed during implementation, apply this checklist:

**Evaluation Checklist:**
- [ ] Does this feature exist in our approved gaps list above?
- [ ] If not, has a new gap entry been filed in `construction/requirements/gap-analysis.md`?
- [ ] Does the new gap trace back to documented stakeholder needs?
- [ ] Has the new gap been validated against constellation map?
- [ ] Has the team formally approved expanding scope?

**Decision Tree:**

1. **Is this feature in the approved gaps list above?**
   - YES → Proceed with implementation
   - NO → Go to step 2

2. **Is this feature required to close an approved gap?**
   - YES → Document dependency and proceed
   - NO → Go to step 3

3. **Does this feature address a new stakeholder need?**
   - YES → File new requirement, update gap analysis, seek approval
   - NO → REJECT - this is opportunistic feature creep

### Review Authority

**Who can approve scope expansion:**
[Define who has authority to approve new gaps]

**Process for scope expansion:**
1. File new requirement with stakeholder justification
2. Update gap analysis document
3. Validate against constellation map
4. Obtain formal approval
5. Update this scope lock document

## Prohibited Patterns (Scope Creep Signals)

NEVER add features for these reasons:

❌ **"While we're building X, we might as well add Y"**
- Reject unless Y closes a validated gap

❌ **"This would be easy to add"**
- Reject unless it closes a validated gap

❌ **"Users might want this in the future"**
- Reject unless documented in stakeholder analysis

❌ **"This is a best practice"**
- Reject unless it addresses a specific constraint in the gap analysis

❌ **"We did this in our last project"**
- Reject unless it closes a validated gap in THIS project

## Scope Change Log

Track all approved scope changes here:

### [Date]: [Feature Name]
**Reason for addition:** [Stakeholder need]
**Documented in:** [Link to updated gap analysis]
**Approved by:** [Authority]
**Impact:** [What changed in scope]

---

## Validation

- [ ] All gaps from `construction/requirements/gap-analysis.md` are listed above
- [ ] All gaps trace to stakeholder needs
- [ ] Governance process is defined
- [ ] Review authority is established
- [ ] Prohibited patterns are documented
- [ ] Team has reviewed and approved this scope lock
</output-format>

<instructions>
CRITICAL: The scope lock is a defensive document. Its purpose is to say NO to feature creep, not to enable gold-plating.

NEVER approve features that:
- Don't appear in the validated gap analysis
- Can't trace back to documented stakeholder needs
- Are added "because we're already building nearby"
- Are justified by "it would be easy"
- Come from "best practices" without specific requirements

DO NOT:
- Allow scope expansion without formal review
- Skip the evaluation checklist for "small" features
- Bypass governance because "it's obviously needed"
- Add features during implementation without documentation
- Let "while we're at it" thinking justify scope creep

ALWAYS:
- Enforce the evaluation checklist for every new feature
- Require traceability to stakeholder needs
- Document scope changes in the change log
- Reject opportunistic features
- Maintain discipline throughout implementation

REPEAT: Every feature must justify its existence through documented, validated gaps. No opportunistic features.

<examples>
✅ Good scope lock decision:
**Feature Request:** "Add email notifications when rate limit is hit"

**Evaluation:**
1. In approved gaps list? NO
2. Required to close approved gap? YES - Gap "API Rate Limiter Between Gateway and Stripe API" has success criterion "Graceful degradation if Redis unavailable" which requires notification
3. Decision: APPROVED - Document as dependency of Gap 1

**Documentation:**
Added to scope lock under Gap 1 dependencies: "Email notification system required for rate limiter degradation alerting"

---

❌ Bad scope lock decision:
**Feature Request:** "Add comprehensive logging framework while we're building the rate limiter"

**Evaluation:**
1. In approved gaps list? NO
2. Required to close approved gap? NO - Rate limiter gap has specific logging requirements, not a comprehensive framework
3. Decision: SHOULD REJECT but approved anyway because "it's a best practice"

**Why this is wrong:**
- No documented stakeholder need for comprehensive logging
- Gap analysis specified specific logging for rate limiter only
- "Best practice" justification bypassed governance
- This is classic scope creep

**Correct decision:** REJECT. Implement only the logging specified in the rate limiter gap. If comprehensive logging is needed, file a new requirement with stakeholder justification.

---

✅ Good scope expansion request:
**Feature Request:** "Add health check endpoint for rate limiter"

**Evaluation:**
1. In approved gaps list? NO
2. Required to close approved gap? Unclear
3. New stakeholder need? YES

**Process followed:**
1. Filed new requirement: "DevOps team needs health checks for all services for Kubernetes liveness probes"
2. Updated gap analysis with new gap: "Service Health Monitoring"
3. Validated against constellation map: No existing star provides this
4. Obtained team approval
5. Updated scope lock document

**Decision:** APPROVED after following full governance process

---

❌ Bad scope expansion:
**Feature Request:** "Add GraphQL API while we're building the REST endpoints for rate limiter"

**Evaluation:**
1. In approved gaps list? NO
2. Required to close approved gap? NO
3. New stakeholder need? NO - not documented anywhere

**Justification given:** "GraphQL is better and we're already building API endpoints"

**Why this is wrong:**
- Classic "while we're at it" thinking
- No stakeholder need documented
- Technical preference, not requirement
- Would significantly expand scope

**Correct decision:** REJECT. Rate limiter gap specifies REST API integration. If GraphQL is needed, it must come from documented stakeholder needs, not developer preference.
