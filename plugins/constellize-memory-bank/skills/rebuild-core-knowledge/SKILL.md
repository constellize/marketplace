description: Rebuild core memory bank files in correct dependency order
---

<task>
Rebuild core knowledge for $0 memory bank systematically, starting with foundation and building up to current state.

Start with project foundation by validating projectbrief.md still describes current goals, scope, and constraints accurately. Update system architecture by rewriting systemPatterns.md to reflect actual implementation, current design decisions, and patterns in active use. Document recent major changes in progress.md showing what was completed during staleness period, what lessons were learned, and how the system evolved. Create fresh current state in activeContext.md capturing today's focus, immediate next steps, and recent decisions. Follow dependency order where foundation documents inform architectural documents inform current state, ensuring consistency across rebuilt knowledge.

Treat rebuilding as systematic reconstruction rather than patchwork repair, establishing solid foundation before building dependent knowledge. This approach ensures coherence across memory bank files and prevents propagation of outdated assumptions into newly rebuilt sections.

Follow this process:

1. **Rebuild foundation first:**
   - Start with projectbrief.md (goals, scope, constraints)
   - Validate core requirements still accurate
   - Update if business direction shifted
   - Establish baseline truth
   - Foundation informs everything else

2. **Reconstruct architecture:**
   - Rewrite systemPatterns.md based on actual code
   - Document current architectural decisions
   - Capture active patterns with examples
   - Map current system topology
   - Architecture defines how we build

3. **Document evolution:**
   - Update progress.md with completed work
   - Capture major changes during staleness
   - Document lessons learned
   - Show system evolution
   - History explains how we got here

4. **Establish current state:**
   - Create fresh activeContext.md
   - Document today's focus and priorities
   - Capture recent key decisions
   - Define clear next steps
   - Current state guides immediate work
</task>

<context>
Project to rebuild memory bank:
$0

Rebuild priority:
$1

**Standard Construction Folder Structure:**
This prompt rebuilds:
- `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` (first - foundation)
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` (second - architecture)
- `memory-bank/progress.md` (third - evolution)
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (fourth - current state)
- `memory-bank/techContext.md` (as needed - tools and setup)
- `memory-bank/productContext.md` (as needed - user needs)

**Rebuild Order:** Foundation → Architecture → History → Current
</context>

<thinking>
Before rebuilding core knowledge, analyze:
1. Which files form the foundation others depend on?
2. What's the correct rebuild order to prevent inconsistency?
3. What current reality must the rebuilt docs reflect?
4. How do we validate rebuilt sections are accurate?
5. What dependencies exist between memory bank files?
6. How do we prevent outdated assumptions in new docs?
</thinking>

<output-format>
Create systematic rebuild following these patterns:

**Rebuild Order Pattern:**

Establish correct sequence:

**Dependency-Based Rebuild Order:**
```
Level 1 (Foundation - rebuild first):
projectbrief.md
└─ Defines: Goals, scope, requirements, constraints
└─ Depends on: Nothing (foundation)
└─ Informs: Everything else

Level 2 (Architecture - rebuild second):
systemPatterns.md
├─ Defines: How we build, patterns, architecture
├─ Depends on: projectbrief.md (requirements drive architecture)
└─ Informs: Implementation decisions

techContext.md
├─ Defines: What we use (tools, technologies)
├─ Depends on: systemPatterns.md (architecture drives tool choices)
└─ Informs: Development setup

Level 3 (Context - rebuild third):
productContext.md
├─ Defines: Why we build (user needs, metrics)
├─ Depends on: projectbrief.md (business goals)
└─ Informs: Feature prioritization

progress.md
├─ Defines: Historical evolution, what's done
├─ Depends on: projectbrief.md, systemPatterns.md
└─ Informs: Current state understanding

Level 4 (Current - rebuild last):
activeContext.md
├─ Defines: Current focus, immediate next steps
├─ Depends on: All above (foundation + architecture + history)
└─ Informs: Day-to-day work

Rebuild Sequence:
1. projectbrief.md (foundation)
2. systemPatterns.md + techContext.md (parallel - architecture)
3. productContext.md + progress.md (parallel - context)
4. activeContext.md (current state - last)

Why this order:
- Foundation before structure
- Architecture before current
- Consistency through dependencies
- New docs built on accurate foundation
```

**Critical Rule:**
```
NEVER rebuild activeContext.md before systemPatterns.md.

Active context describes work within architecture.
If architecture doc wrong, active context will be wrong.

Always: Foundation → Architecture → Current
```

---

**Foundation Rebuild Pattern:**

Start with projectbrief.md:

**Foundation Validation Checklist:**
```
Review projectbrief.md for currency:

Project Goals:
□ Do stated goals still match business direction?
□ Have priorities shifted?
□ Are success metrics still relevant?
□ Has scope expanded or contracted?

Requirements:
□ Are core requirements still valid?
□ Have new constraints emerged?
□ Have any requirements been dropped?
□ Has compliance landscape changed?

Team & Resources:
□ Is team structure current?
□ Have resource constraints changed?
□ Are timelines still realistic?
□ Has ownership shifted?

Assumptions:
□ Are stated assumptions still true?
□ Have any been invalidated by reality?
□ Are there new assumptions to document?

If ANY "no": Foundation needs updating before proceeding.
```

**Architecture Rebuild Pattern:**

Rebuild systemPatterns.md from actual code:

**Architecture Discovery Process:**
```
Don't write architecture from memory.
Discover it from actual implementation.

1. Map current system structure (2 hours):
   - Draw diagram from actual code
   - List all services/components that exist
   - Document communication paths
   - Map data flows
   - Note deployment topology

2. Extract active patterns (3 hours):
   - Review recent PRs for patterns used
   - Identify consistent approaches
   - Document with real code examples
   - Note conventions being followed
   - Capture rationale where evident

3. Document decisions (2 hours):
   - Identify major architectural choices
   - Research why chosen (git history, team)
   - Document alternatives considered
   - Capture trade-offs made
   - Link to current implementation

4. Validate with team (1 hour):
   - Review architecture doc with engineers
   - Confirm accuracy
   - Add missing context
   - Correct misunderstandings

Total: 8 hours for thorough architecture rebuild
```

Next update: [Date + 1 week]
Owner: [Current steward]
```

---

**Consistency Validation Pattern:**

Ensure rebuilt files align:

**Cross-File Consistency Checks:**
```
After rebuilding all core files:

□ projectbrief.md goals ↔ activeContext.md priorities
  Check: Current work advances stated goals

□ systemPatterns.md architecture ↔ techContext.md tools
  Check: Tool choices support architectural patterns

□ systemPatterns.md patterns ↔ activeContext.md recent decisions
  Check: Recent decisions align with established patterns

□ progress.md completions ↔ projectbrief.md success criteria
  Check: Completed work progresses success metrics

□ activeContext.md next steps ↔ systemPatterns.md architecture
  Check: Next actions consistent with architecture

□ All files reference same current reality
  Check: No conflicting information across files

If inconsistencies found:
1. Identify which file is accurate (check code)
2. Update others to match truth
3. Add cross-references for clarity
```

---

**Rebuild Workflow Pattern:**

Step-by-step execution:

**Rebuild Schedule:**
```
Day 1: Foundation (3 hours)
- Review and update projectbrief.md (2 hours)
- Validate with team (30 min)
- Get approval to proceed (30 min)

Day 2-3: Architecture (8 hours)
- Map current system structure (2 hours)
- Extract active patterns (3 hours)
- Document decisions (2 hours)
- Validate with team (1 hour)

Day 4: Context (6 hours)
- Reconstruct history for progress.md (5 hours)
- Update productContext.md if needed (1 hour)

Day 5: Current State (2 hours)
- Create fresh activeContext.md (1 hour)
- Cross-file consistency check (30 min)
- Final team review (30 min)

Total: 19 hours over 1 week
Result: Complete core knowledge rebuilt

Can parallelize some work:
- techContext.md alongside systemPatterns.md
- productContext.md alongside progress.md
```

</output-format>

<instructions>
CRITICAL: Rebuild systematically in dependency order.

NEVER rebuild by:
- Starting with activeContext.md (current depends on foundation)
- Writing from memory (must reflect actual code)
- Rebuilding files in parallel without dependencies (inconsistency)
- Skipping validation (might be wrong)
- Forgetting to check cross-file consistency (conflicts)

DO NOT:
- Rebuild current state before architecture
- Document aspirational architecture (must be actual)
- Skip team validation
- Leave inconsistencies between files
- Rush through rebuild
- Copy old content without verification

ALWAYS:
- Follow dependency order (foundation → architecture → current)
- Discover architecture from actual code
- Validate rebuilt sections with team
- Check cross-file consistency
- Document evolution, not just current state
- Create fresh activeContext.md (not historical)

REPEAT: Rebuild in order (foundation → architecture → history → current). Validate each level before proceeding. Ensure consistency across files.
</instructions>

<examples>
✅ GOOD Rebuild (systematic, validated, consistent):

**Pattern demonstrates:**
- Correct rebuild order
- Architecture from actual code
- Team validation
- Cross-file consistency
- Fresh current state

**Example rebuild:**
```
Core Knowledge Rebuild: API Service
Timeline: 1 week (Jan 15-19, 2026)

---

DAY 1: FOUNDATION (3 hours)

Reviewed projectbrief.md:

Found:
- Goals still accurate ✓
- Scope expanded (added mobile API)
- New constraint (PCI compliance required)
- Success metrics still relevant ✓

Updated projectbrief.md:

Scope Changes:
- Added: Mobile API support (Dec 2025)
  Reason: Business prioritized mobile app

New Constraints:
- PCI DSS Level 1 compliance required
  Added: Jan 2026
  Impact: Architecture, security, audit requirements

Team validation:
- Reviewed with product manager: Approved ✓
- Reviewed with tech lead: Approved ✓

Foundation is now accurate.
Proceeding to architecture.

---

DAY 2-3: ARCHITECTURE (8 hours)

Mapped current system from code:

Discovered actual structure:
- API Gateway (Express) - routes requests
- Auth Service (microservice) - JWT handling
- Payment Service (microservice) - Stripe integration
- Notification Service (microservice) - push notifications
- PostgreSQL (primary data)
- Redis (caching, sessions)

NOT what old docs said:
- Old docs: Monolith
- Reality: Microservices
- Migration: Happened Dec 2025

Extracted active patterns from last 20 PRs:

Pattern 1: Service Error Handling
- Every service uses try-catch with structured logging
- Custom error types extend base Error
- Example from PaymentService.js:
  ```javascript
  try {
    const result = await stripe.charge(amount);
    logger.info('Payment succeeded', { orderId, transactionId });
    return result;
  } catch (error) {
    logger.error('Payment failed', { orderId, amount, error });
    throw new PaymentError('Payment processing failed', error);
  }
  ```
- Location: src/services/*/

Pattern 2: API Authentication
- JWT in Authorization header
- Gateway validates, attaches user to request
- Services trust gateway validation
- Example from authMiddleware.js
- Location: src/middleware/authMiddleware.js

Pattern 3: Inter-Service Communication
- gRPC for service-to-service
- REST/JSON for client-to-gateway
- Event bus (RabbitMQ) for async
- Example from OrderService calling PaymentService
- Location: src/services/*/clients/

Documented architectural decisions:

Decision: Microservices Architecture
- Date: Dec 2025
- Context: Monolith couldn't scale, team wanted service ownership
- Rationale: Better scalability, clearer boundaries, independent deploy
- Alternatives: Keep monolith (rejected - scale limit), serverless (rejected - complexity)
- Trade-offs: Gained scale, lost simplicity
- Status: Current, working well

Decision: gRPC for Inter-Service
- Date: Dec 2025
- Context: Need fast inter-service communication
- Rationale: Performance, type safety, streaming support
- Alternatives: REST (rejected - slower), message queue (rejected - not request/response)
- Trade-offs: Gained performance, lost REST simplicity
- Status: Current

Rebuilt systemPatterns.md (6 hours):
- Architecture section: Microservices diagram
- 8 core patterns documented
- 5 major decisions captured
- All with real code examples

Team validation (1 hour):
- Reviewed with 4 engineers
- Confirmed architecture accurate
- Added 2 clarifications
- Approved ✓

Architecture is now accurate.
Proceeding to history and current state.

  Impact: Able to process cards directly

Updated progress.md:
- 12 feature completions detailed
- 8 major learnings captured
- System evolution timeline shown
- Current status updated

---

DAY 5: CURRENT STATE (2 hours)

Created fresh activeContext.md:

Current Focus (Sprint ending Jan 26):
- Performance optimization
- Mobile app bug fixes
- PCI audit preparation

Top Priorities:
1. API response time (Alice) - 300ms → 150ms target
2. iOS crash fix (Bob) - Blocking app release
3. Audit documentation (Charlie) - Needed for compliance

Recent Decisions (last 2 weeks):
- Jan 15: Use Redis for API caching
  Rationale: 50% of requests cache-able, huge latency win
  Impact: Need caching strategy, monitoring

- Jan 18: Add GraphQL query complexity limits
  Rationale: Prevent DoS via expensive queries
  Impact: Need monitoring, potential breaking change

Team:
- Alice (Senior): Performance lead
- Bob (Mid): Mobile/iOS specialist
- Charlie (Mid): Security/compliance
- Diana (Junior): API features

Open Questions:
- Should we add rate limiting? (Decision needed by Jan 30)
- WebSocket for real-time? (Exploring, decision Feb 15)

Current Blockers:
- iOS crash: Hard to reproduce (Bob investigating)

activeContext.md created (fresh, current).

---

CONSISTENCY CHECK (30 min):

Cross-file validation:

✓ projectbrief.md goals ↔ activeContext.md priorities
  - Goal: "Fast, reliable API" matches priority "API response time"

✓ systemPatterns.md architecture ↔ techContext.md tools
  - Microservices documented, services in techContext match

✓ systemPatterns.md patterns ↔ activeContext.md decisions
  - Recent caching decision aligns with patterns

✓ progress.md completions ↔ projectbrief.md success
  - Stripe integration advances revenue goal

✓ activeContext.md next steps ↔ systemPatterns.md
  - Performance work aligns with architecture

✓ All files reference current reality
  - No conflicts found

Consistency validated ✓

---

FINAL TEAM REVIEW (30 min):

Reviewed rebuilt memory bank with team:

Feedback:
- "Finally accurate again!"
- "Architecture section really helpful"
- "History captures what we learned"
- "Current state matches sprint board"

Approval: UNANIMOUS ✓

---

RESULTS:

Time invested: 19 hours over 1 week
Files rebuilt: 4 core files (projectbrief, systemPatterns, progress, activeContext)

Quality:
- All files validated by team
- Architecture matches actual code
- History captures evolution
- Current state is fresh
- Cross-file consistency confirmed

Team confidence: 9/10 (was 3/10)
New engineer feedback: "Memory bank makes sense now"

Core knowledge successfully rebuilt.
Systematic approach prevented inconsistencies.
Foundation → architecture → current order worked perfectly.
```

**Why this works:**
- Followed dependency order strictly
- Architecture discovered from actual code, not memory
- Each level validated before proceeding
- Cross-file consistency checked
- Team validation at each stage
- Fresh current state created
- Realistic time investment
- Clear result: accurate, consistent memory bank

---

❌ BAD Rebuild (wrong order, no validation, inconsistent):

**Anti-pattern characteristics:**
- Wrong rebuild order
- Architecture from memory
- No validation
- Inconsistent across files

**Bad rebuild:**
```
Rebuilt memory bank:

Day 1: Rewrote activeContext.md with current work
Day 2: Updated systemPatterns.md from memory
Day 3: Touched up other files

Done!

(Wrong order: current before architecture)
(No code validation: architecture from memory)
(No team validation: might be wrong)
(No consistency check: files might conflict)
```

**Why this fails:**
```
What happened:

Week later:
- New engineer: "activeContext doesn't match systemPatterns"
- Engineer: "Which is correct?"
- Team: "Not sure, need to check code"

Investigation revealed:
- activeContext based on outdated architecture understanding
- systemPatterns doesn't match actual code
- Files contradict each other
- Memory bank still confusing

Result:
- 3 days wasted on wrong rebuild order
- Files inconsistent
- Team still doesn't trust memory bank
- Have to redo properly

Could have been prevented:
- Follow correct order: foundation → architecture → current
- Validate against actual code
- Check cross-file consistency
- Get team approval
```

**Lesson:**
```
Rebuild order matters enormously.

Current state depends on architecture.
Architecture must reflect actual code.
Foundation informs everything.
