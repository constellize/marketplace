---

<task>
Establish lightweight stewardship practices for $0 memory bank to prevent future degradation through sustainable maintenance rhythm.

Implement automated review scheduling that prompts regular memory bank currency checks without manual tracking. Integrate memory bank updates into PR checklist making documentation updates part of standard development workflow rather than separate activity. Create rotating steward role with weekly rotation ensuring distributed responsibility and preventing single-person burden. Define clear stewardship responsibilities including currency validation, update facilitation, and quality monitoring. Build cultural expectation that memory bank maintenance is infrastructure work, not optional documentation task.

Treat stewardship establishment as process design rather than individual assignment, creating systems that make good practice easy and sustainable. This approach prevents memory bank degradation through continuous light maintenance rather than periodic heavy recovery.

Follow this process:

1. **Implement automated prompts:**
   - Schedule weekly memory bank review reminders
   - Add memory bank check to PR template
   - Create CI validation for basic currency
   - Set up staleness alerts
   - Make remembering automatic

2. **Establish rotation responsibility:**
   - Define steward role clearly
   - Create weekly rotation schedule
   - Document steward duties
   - Make rotation visible to team
   - Distribute burden fairly

3. **Integrate into workflow:**
   - Add to definition of done
   - Include in code review checklist
   - Make part of sprint rituals
   - Connect to existing practices
   - Remove friction from updates

4. **Build cultural expectation:**
   - Leadership endorsement visible
   - Recognize good stewardship
   - Show impact of currency
   - Make normal, not exceptional
   - Celebrate maintenance work
</task>

<context>
Project to establish stewardship:
$0

Team size:
$1

**Standard Construction Folder Structure:**
This prompt creates:
- Steward role definition and rotation schedule
- Automated reminder and validation scripts
- PR template updates and checklists
- Cultural practices and recognition systems
- Monitoring dashboards for memory bank health
</context>

<thinking>
Before establishing stewardship, analyze:
1. What makes memory bank updates easy vs hard?
2. How can we automate remembering?
3. What's a sustainable rotation schedule?
4. How do we integrate with existing workflow?
5. What cultural changes need leadership support?
6. How do we measure stewardship success?
</thinking>

<output-format>
Create stewardship establishment following these patterns:

**Automated Review Pattern:**

Make remembering automatic:

**Weekly Review Reminder:**
```bash
# .github/workflows/memory-bank-reminder.yml
# Runs every Monday 9am

name: Memory Bank Weekly Review

on:
  schedule:
    - cron: '0 9 * * 1'  # Every Monday 9am UTC

jobs:
  reminder:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Post Slack Reminder
        run: |
          curl -X POST ${{ secrets.SLACK_WEBHOOK }} \
            -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
            -d '{
              "text": "📚 Weekly Memory Bank Review",
              "blocks": [{
                "type": "section",
                "text": {
                  "type": "mrkdwn",
                  "text": "*Memory Bank Weekly Review*\n\nThis week'\''s steward: @${{ env.CURRENT_STEWARD }}\n\n*Review checklist:*\n• activeContext.md reflects current sprint\n• Recent decisions documented\n• Completed work in progress.md\n• No stale entries\n\nLast update: ${{ env.DAYS_SINCE_UPDATE }} days ago"
                }
              }]
            }'

# Sends gentle weekly reminder
# Tags current steward
# Shows days since last update
# Links to review checklist
```

**Steward Role Pattern:**

Define clear responsibilities:

**Steward Role Definition:**
```markdown
# Memory Bank Steward Role

## Overview
Weekly rotating role ensuring memory bank stays current and useful.

## Duration
- 1 week (Monday - Friday)
- Rotates every Monday
- ~1-2 hours per week

## Responsibilities

### Daily (10 min/day):
1. **Monitor for updates needed:**
   - Review PRs for memory bank impact
   - Flag PRs missing memory bank updates
   - Ensure PR template checkbox completed

2. **Quick currency check:**
   - Scan activeContext.md (is it current?)
   - Note any obvious staleness
   - Flag for correction if needed

### Weekly (1 hour):
1. **Memory bank review:**
   - Review each memory bank file
   - Check file references still valid
   - Verify activeContext.md reflects current sprint
   - Confirm recent decisions documented
   - Validate progress.md has completed work

2. **Update facilitation:**
   - Remind team of pending updates
   - Help engineers with memory bank questions
   - Facilitate uncertain content clarification
   - Ensure quality of updates

3. **Health reporting:**
   - Run memory bank health dashboard
   - Report status in standup
   - Escalate concerns to tech lead
   - Document issues in weekly summary

### Handoff (15 min):
1. **Transfer to next steward:**
   - Brief on current state
   - Note pending updates
   - Share learnings
   - Answer questions

## Not Responsible For:
- Writing all updates yourself (team writes, you facilitate)
- Perfection (good enough is fine)
- Historical updates (focus on keeping current)

## Success Metrics:
- Memory bank updated at least weekly
- PRs with memory bank impact have updates
- Team confidence >7/10
- No files stale >30 days

## Escalation:
If memory bank degrading despite your efforts:
→ Raise in standup
→ Ask tech lead for help
→ Discuss friction points
→ Adjust process as needed

## Tips:
- Don't do all the work yourself
- Ask questions publicly (teach team)
- Make it easy for others to contribute
- Recognize good updates
- It's okay to be imperfect

## Current Steward:
[Auto-updated by rotation script]

Week of [Date]: [Name]
```

**Rotation Schedule:**
```markdown
# Memory Bank Steward Rotation

## Schedule
Weekly rotation, every Monday.

| Week Starting | Steward | Backup |
|---------------|---------|--------|
| 2026-01-20    | Alice   | Bob    |
| 2026-01-27    | Bob     | Charlie|
| 2026-02-03    | Charlie | Diana  |
| 2026-02-10    | Diana   | Eve    |
| 2026-02-17    | Eve     | Alice  |
| 2026-02-24    | Alice   | Bob    |
| ...           | ...     | ...    |

## Rotation Order:
Alice → Bob → Charlie → Diana → Eve → (repeat)

## Backup Responsibility:
- Steps in if steward unavailable
- Helps with handoff
- Shares load for big updates

## Out of Office:
If scheduled steward OOO:
1. Backup becomes steward
2. Next in rotation becomes backup
3. Update schedule doc

## Adding New Team Members:
- Add to rotation after 2 weeks onboarding
- Pair with experienced steward first week
- Full steward second week

## Removing Team Members:
- Remove from rotation
- Adjust schedule

## Current Rotation:**
Auto-updated by `scripts/update-steward.sh`

## History:
Track good stewardship for recognition
```

**Rotation Automation:**
```bash
#!/bin/bash
# scripts/update-steward.sh
# Run every Monday via cron

# Get current date
today=$(date +%Y-%m-%d)

# Rotation list
stewards=("Alice" "Bob" "Charlie" "Diana" "Eve")

# Find current steward (weekly rotation)
week_number=$(date +%U)
index=$((week_number % ${#stewards[@]}))
current_steward=${stewards[$index]}
next_index=$(((index + 1) % ${#stewards[@]}))
backup_steward=${stewards[$next_index]}

# Update rotation schedule
echo "Updating steward rotation..."
echo "Current week: $today"
echo "Current steward: $current_steward"
echo "Backup: $backup_steward"

# Update steward file
cat > memory-bank/.steward << EOF
Current Steward: $current_steward
Backup: $backup_steward
Week of: $today
EOF

# Post to Slack
curl -X POST $SLACK_WEBHOOK \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d "{
    \"text\": \"📚 Memory Bank Steward for week of $today: @$current_steward (backup: @$backup_steward)\"
  }"

# Update GitHub issue board
# (implementation depends on your issue tracking)

echo "Steward rotation updated"
```

**Workflow Integration Pattern:**

Make memory bank updates natural:

**Definition of Done:**
```markdown
# Definition of Done

A story/task is done when:

## Code Complete:
- [ ] Code written and working
- [ ] Tests passing (unit, integration)
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved
- [ ] No obvious bugs

## Documentation Complete:
- [ ] Code comments where needed
- [ ] API documentation updated
- [ ] **Memory bank updated** (if applicable)

## Quality Gates:
- [ ] CI passing
- [ ] Security scan clear
- [ ] Performance acceptable

## Memory Bank Updates (when applicable):

**Update when:**
- New feature added
- Architecture changed
- Pattern established
- Tool/dependency added
- Decision made

**Which files:**
- systemPatterns.md: Architectural patterns/decisions
- techContext.md: Tools, setup, conventions
- activeContext.md: Recent decisions, current focus
- progress.md: Completed work

**Not done until memory bank updated** (if applicable)

Steward validates memory bank updates in code review.
```

**Code Review Checklist:**
```markdown
# Code Review Checklist

If memory bank updated:
→ Verify quality (specific, accurate, useful)
→ Check cross-references correct
→ Confirm appropriate file updated

**Steward** should focus extra attention on memory bank updates.
```

**Sprint Rituals Integration:**
```markdown
# Sprint Rituals - Memory Bank Integration

## Daily Standup (add 1 minute):
**Steward reports (30 sec):**
- "Memory bank current" OR
- "Needs: [specific update]"
- "Blocker: [if any]"

## Sprint Planning (add 5 minutes):
**Memory bank prep:**
- Review activeContext.md for accuracy
- Confirm reflects new sprint goals
- Update current focus section
- Document sprint context

## Sprint Review (add 3 minutes):
**Demo completed work:**
- Ensure demoed features in progress.md
- Document lessons learned

## Sprint Retrospective (add 5 minutes):
**Memory bank health check:**
- How accurate was memory bank this sprint?
- Did it help or hinder?
- What should we improve?
- Any degradation noticed?

**Action items** if memory bank degrading.

Total time added: ~15 min per 2-week sprint
Benefit: Continuous reinforcement, early problem detection
```

```

**Recognition System:**
```markdown
# Memory Bank Stewardship Recognition

## Weekly:
- Shout out in standup
- "Thanks [Name] for excellent stewardship this week"
- Specific examples: "activeContext.md was spot-on"

## Monthly:
- "Steward of the Month" recognition
- Criteria: Above-and-beyond effort
- Slack announcement, team kudos
- Optional: Small reward (coffee card, etc)

## Quarterly:
- Include in performance reviews
- "Strong documentation stewardship"
- "Helped maintain team knowledge infrastructure"
- Counts toward career growth

## Annually:
- Team award: "Best Knowledge Stewardship"
- Part of engineering excellence
- Recognition in company communications

## Success Stories:
Document and share:
- "New engineer productive in 1 week (was 4 weeks)"
- "Memory bank helped us avoid outage"
- "Caught bug by reviewing memory bank"

Make stewardship visible and valued.
Not thankless invisible work.
Real contribution to team success.
```

**Impact Demonstration:**
```markdown
# Showing Memory Bank Value

Track and share impact:

## New Engineer Onboarding:
- Before memory bank: 4 weeks to productivity
- After memory bank: 1 week to productivity
- Savings: 3 weeks per new hire

## Context Recovery:
- Without memory bank: 2-3 hours asking questions
- With memory bank: 15 minutes reading docs
- Savings: 2+ hours per context reset

## Decision Quality:
- Memory bank documents rationale
- New decisions built on past learnings
- Avoid repeating mistakes
- Value: Better decisions, less churn

## Team Confidence:
Survey team quarterly:
- "I can understand our architecture" (1-10)
- "I know why decisions were made" (1-10)
- "I trust our documentation" (1-10)

Show improvement over time.

## Incident Prevention:
- "Memory bank helped us catch X before production"
- "Remembered constraint Y, avoided outage"

Document and share these stories.

## Cost of Staleness:
When memory bank was stale:
- 2 weeks to recover
- 3 engineers' time
- New engineer struggled for month

Prevention cost: 30 min/week/engineer
Much cheaper than recovery.

**Show the ROI of stewardship.**
Makes investment obvious.
```

  Target: 100% (every week has steward)
- Update facilitation (updates per steward week)
  Target: ≥1
- Issues escalated
  Target: <1 per month (healthy)

## Trend Analysis:
Track monthly:
- Currency improving or degrading?
- Quality stable or declining?
- Team confidence up or down?

If degrading: Investigate and address.

Dashboard these metrics.

```

**Adjustment Triggers:**
```markdown
# When to Adjust Stewardship Practices

## Red Flags (act immediately):
- Memory bank not updated in >2 weeks
- Multiple files with broken references
- Team confidence <5/10
- New engineers struggling despite memory bank
- Steward role skipped 2+ weeks in row

**Action:** Team discussion, identify root cause, adjust practices

## Yellow Flags (investigate):
- Updates declining (was 3/week, now 1/week)
- Stewards reporting high burden (>3 hours/week)
- Team forgetting to update
- PR template checkbox ignored

**Action:** Discuss in retro, reduce friction, re-emphasize

## Positive Signals (scale up):
- Team confidence >8/10
- Updates happening without prompting
- New engineers productive quickly
- Memory bank cited in decision-making

**Action:** Document success, share practices, mentor other teams

## Regular Review:
Quarterly: Full practice review
- What's working well?
- What's friction?
- What should we change?
- How can we improve?

Iterate on practices.
Continuous improvement.
```

</output-format>

<instructions>
CRITICAL: Stewardship is process design, not individual heroics.

NEVER establish stewardship by:
- Assigning to one person permanently (burnout, single point of failure)
- Adding burden without automation (unsustainable)
- Making updates onerous (high friction = won't happen)
- Hoping team remembers (need systems)
- Treating as optional (will be skipped)

DO NOT:
- Make one person responsible forever
- Skip automation of reminders
- Add work without reducing friction
- Forget workflow integration
- Miss leadership endorsement
- Ignore cultural change needs

ALWAYS:
- Rotate steward responsibility
- Automate reminders and validation
- Integrate into existing workflow
- Reduce friction maximally
- Get leadership visible commitment
- Build cultural expectation
- Monitor and adjust practices

REPEAT: Stewardship is sustainable through rotation, automation, integration, and culture. Make good practice easy and normal.
</instructions>

<examples>
✅ GOOD Stewardship Establishment (sustainable, systematic, cultural):

**Pattern demonstrates:**
- Rotation prevents burnout
- Automation makes remembering easy
- Integration makes updates natural
- Culture makes stewardship normal

**Example establishment:**
```
Stewardship Establishment: API Team
Team: 6 engineers
Timeline: 2 weeks to full implementation

SUCCESS FACTORS:

1. **Rotation:** No single person burden
   - Everyone steward 1 week per 6 weeks
   - ~1-2 hours per steward week
   - Sustainable long-term

2. **Automation:** Made remembering easy
   - Weekly reminders work
   - PR template catches at right time
   - CI validation provides safety net
   - Dashboard shows status at glance

3. **Integration:** Updates feel natural
   - Part of definition of done
   - In code review checklist
   - Connected to sprint rituals
   - Not separate activity

4. **Culture:** Team bought in
   - Leadership endorsed visibly
   - Recognition for good work
   - Impact demonstrated clearly
   - "Normal" to update

5. **Friction Reduction:** Updates easy
   - Templates provide structure
   - Scripts save time
   - Documentation clear
   - Tools accessible

Result: Sustainable stewardship established.
Memory bank stays current without heroics.
Team confidence high and stable.
New engineers productive quickly.
Knowledge infrastructure reliable.

"Stewardship just works now. It's how we operate."
- Tech Lead
```

**Why this works:**
- Systematic establishment over 2 weeks
- Automation removes remembering burden
- Rotation distributes responsibility
- Integration makes updates natural
- Culture change supported by leadership
- Friction minimized with tools
- Metrics tracked and improving
- Sustainable long-term
- Team bought in completely

❌ BAD Stewardship Establishment (unsustainable, individual-dependent):

**Anti-pattern characteristics:**
- Assigned to one person
- No automation
- Not integrated
- High friction
- No cultural change

**Bad establishment:**
```
"Alice, you're good at documentation. Can you keep
the memory bank updated? Thanks!"

(No rotation - Alice alone)
(No automation - Alice must remember)
(No integration - separate from workflow)
(No tools - Alice does everything manually)
(No cultural change - seen as Alice's job)
```

**Why this fails:**
```
Week 1-2: Alice tries hard
- Updates memory bank
- Reminds team to update
- Reviews all PRs for memory bank impact
- Spending 5+ hours/week

Week 3-4: Alice getting tired
- Other work piling up
- Memory bank updates slipping
- Team not helping (not their job)
- Alice frustrated

Week 5-6: Alice burns out
- Stops updating regularly
- Too much burden
- No support from team
- Memory bank degrading

Week 7: Alice on vacation
- No backup
- No updates for week
- Memory bank falls behind

Week 8+: Abandonment
- Alice can't sustain alone
- Team never adopted responsibility
- Memory bank goes stale
- Back to square one

Result:
- Alice burned out
- Memory bank failed
- Single point of failure
- Unsustainable from start
```

**Impact:**
```
"We tried having a memory bank steward but it didn't work.
Too much work for one person. We gave up."

Could have been prevented:
- Rotate responsibility (don't burn out individuals)
- Automate reminders (don't rely on memory)
- Integrate into workflow (make normal)
- Reduce friction (make easy)
- Build culture (everyone's responsibility)

Stewardship works when it's systematic, not when it's
individual heroics.
```

**Lesson:**
```
Don't assign stewardship to one person permanently.

Single person = Single point of failure
No rotation = Burnout inevitable
No automation = Won't be sustained
No integration = Seen as extra work
No culture change = Treated as optional

Good stewardship is systematic:
- Automated reminders
- Rotating responsibility
- Workflow integration
- Minimal friction
- Cultural expectation

Make it easy, distributed, and normal.
Then it works long-term.
