description: Triage moderately stale memory bank to assess salvageability
---

<task>
Triage salvageable knowledge in memory bank for $0 to determine what remains accurate, what needs minor updates, and what must be archived.

Identify accurate entries that still reflect current reality by comparing documentation against actual codebase, validating architectural descriptions match implementation, and confirming patterns documented are patterns used. Mark entries needing minor updates where core information is correct but details have drifted, file paths changed, or examples need refreshing. Archive completely obsolete entries where documented approaches are no longer in use, technologies have been replaced, or features have been removed. Assess salvageability systematically by reviewing each memory bank file, categorizing every entry by accuracy level, estimating update effort required, and prioritizing triage work.

Treat triage as honest assessment rather than wishful thinking, acknowledging gaps between documentation and reality while identifying what can be saved with reasonable effort. This approach prevents wasted time updating truly obsolete entries while preserving valuable knowledge that needs only minor correction.

Follow this process:

1. **Assess overall staleness:**
   - Review last update date for each file
   - Identify major changes since last update
   - Estimate drift severity
   - Determine triage scope
   - Set realistic recovery timeline

2. **Categorize every entry:**
   - Still accurate: Mark reviewed, keep as-is
   - Minor updates needed: Flag specific changes required
   - Major rewrite needed: Mark for rebuild
   - Completely obsolete: Archive with explanation
   - Uncertain: Validate before categorizing

3. **Estimate recovery effort:**
   - Count entries by category
   - Assess time per entry type
   - Calculate total recovery work
   - Prioritize by value and effort
   - Create phased recovery plan

4. **Mark and preserve:**
   - Add review dates to accurate entries
   - Flag update needs clearly
   - Create archive for obsolete entries
   - Document uncertainty for unclear cases
   - Maintain all content during triage
</task>

<context>
Project to triage memory bank:
$0

Staleness period:
$1

**Standard Construction Folder Structure:**
This prompt reviews:
- `memory-bank/projectbrief.md` (foundation accuracy)
- `memory-bank/systemPatterns.md` (architecture currency)
- `memory-bank/techContext.md` (tool and convention accuracy)
- `memory-bank/productContext.md` (user need relevance)
- `memory-bank/activeContext.md` (current state accuracy)
- `memory-bank/progress.md` (completion tracking accuracy)

This prompt creates:
- Triage assessment report
- Categorized entry inventory
- Recovery effort estimate
- Phased recovery plan
</context>

<thinking>
Before triaging memory bank, analyze:
1. How stale is the memory bank overall?
2. Which files are most critical to accuracy?
3. What major changes happened during staleness period?
4. How much effort is realistic for recovery?
5. Which entries provide most value if updated?
6. What can we afford to archive vs must preserve?
</thinking>

<output-format>
Create triage assessment following these patterns:

**Overall Staleness Assessment Pattern:**

Establish baseline understanding:

**Staleness Review:**
```
Timeline:
- Last comprehensive update: [Date]
- Staleness duration: [Weeks/months]
- Major changes during period: [Count and summary]
- Team changes: [People joined/left]
- Technology changes: [Tools added/removed]

Current State:
- Lines of code changed: [Estimate]
- Features shipped: [Count]
- Architecture changes: [Major/Minor/None]
- Pattern evolution: [Significant/Moderate/Minimal]

Drift Severity:
□ Minimal (< 1 month, small changes)
  Impact: Minor touch-ups needed
  Effort: 2-4 hours

□ Moderate (1-3 months, moderate changes)
  Impact: Some sections need rewriting
  Effort: 1-2 days

□ Significant (3-6 months, major changes)
  Impact: Large portions need rebuilding
  Effort: 3-5 days

□ Severe (> 6 months, extensive changes)
  Impact: Consider full recovery approach
  Effort: 1-2 weeks

Current Assessment: [Selected severity]
```

**Priority Files:**
```
Rank by importance to accuracy:

Critical (must be accurate for team to function):
1. [File]: [Why critical]
2. [File]: [Why critical]

Important (valuable if accurate, but not blocking):
3. [File]: [Why important]
4. [File]: [Why important]

Nice to have (helpful but lower priority):
5. [File]: [Why nice to have]

Focus triage on critical files first.
```

---

**Entry Categorization Pattern:**

Systematic assessment of every entry:

**Accuracy Categories:**
```
Category 1: ACCURATE (Keep as-is)
- Still reflects current reality
- File references valid
- Patterns match actual use
- Examples work
Action: Mark with "Reviewed [date]", no changes needed

Category 2: MINOR UPDATES (Small fixes)
- Core information correct
- Details drifted (file paths, versions, examples)
- Quick fixes (< 15 min per entry)
- Structure still valid
Action: Flag specific changes needed, schedule fix

Category 3: MAJOR UPDATES (Rewrite needed)
- Core information outdated
- Significant changes required
- Substantial effort (> 30 min per entry)
- May need validation with team
Action: Mark for rebuild, add to recovery plan

Category 4: OBSOLETE (Archive)
- No longer applicable
- Technology removed
- Feature deleted
- Approach abandoned
Action: Move to archived/ with explanation

Category 5: UNCERTAIN (Validate first)
- Can't determine accuracy from documentation alone
- Need code review or team input
- Ambiguous whether current or obsolete
Action: Flag for validation, categorize after clarification
```

**Entry Assessment Template:**
```
Entry: [Section name]
File: [Which memory bank file]
Topic: [What it's about]

Assessment:
□ Accurate - Reviewed [date], no changes needed
□ Minor updates - [Specific changes required]
□ Major updates - [Why rewrite needed]
□ Obsolete - [Why no longer relevant]
□ Uncertain - [What needs validation]

Evidence:
- [Why you categorized this way]

Effort estimate (if update needed): [Minutes/hours]
Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
```

---

**File-by-File Triage Pattern:**

Systematic review process:

**Triage Workflow:**
```
For each memory bank file:

1. Read completely (15-30 min per file)
2. For each section/entry:
   - Compare to current codebase
   - Check file references
   - Validate patterns against actual code
   - Assess examples for accuracy
   - Categorize (accurate/minor/major/obsolete/uncertain)
3. Create triage report for file
4. Estimate recovery effort
5. Move to next file

Order of triage:
1. projectbrief.md (foundation)
2. systemPatterns.md (architecture)
3. activeContext.md (current state)
4. techContext.md (tools and conventions)
5. productContext.md (user needs)
6. progress.md (history)
```

**File Triage Template:**
```
File: [memory-bank/filename.md]
Reviewed: [Date]
Reviewer: [Name]

Entries by Category:

ACCURATE (keep as-is):
- [Section 1]: Reviewed, current
- [Section 2]: Reviewed, current
Total: [count] entries

MINOR UPDATES needed:
- [Section 3]: Update file path from X to Y
- [Section 4]: Refresh example with current code
Total: [count] entries, estimated [hours] to fix

MAJOR UPDATES needed:
- [Section 5]: Architecture changed, needs rewrite
- [Section 6]: Pattern evolved, needs new examples
Total: [count] entries, estimated [hours] to rebuild

OBSOLETE (archive):
- [Section 7]: Technology removed (date)
- [Section 8]: Feature deleted (date)
Total: [count] entries to archive

UNCERTAIN (validate):
- [Section 9]: Can't verify without team input
- [Section 10]: Ambiguous whether current
Total: [count] entries needing validation

Overall File Status:
- Salvageable: [%]
- Needs work: [%]
- Obsolete: [%]
- Recovery effort: [hours]
- Priority: [High/Medium/Low]
```

---

**Effort Estimation Pattern:**

Calculate realistic recovery time:

**Recovery Effort Calculator:**
```
Accurate entries (no work):
Count: [X] entries
Effort: 0 hours (just mark reviewed)

Minor update entries:
Count: [Y] entries
Effort per entry: 10 minutes average
Total: [Y × 10/60] hours

Major update entries:
Count: [Z] entries
Effort per entry: 1 hour average
Total: [Z × 1] hours

Obsolete entries (archive):
Count: [A] entries
Effort per entry: 15 minutes (create retirement notice)
Total: [A × 15/60] hours

Uncertain entries (validate):
Count: [B] entries
Effort per entry: 30 minutes (validate + categorize + fix)
Total: [B × 30/60] hours

Subtotal: [Sum] hours

Add overhead:
- Validation with team: 2 hours
- Review and approval: 1 hour
- Documentation of triage: 1 hour

Total Recovery Effort: [Sum + overhead] hours

Realistic timeline:
- 2 hours/day: [Total/2] days
- 4 hours/day: [Total/4] days
- 1 full day: [Total/8] days
```

**Effort vs Value Matrix:**
```
Plot each file:

High Value, Low Effort (Do First):
- [File]: [Why high value] - [X hours]

High Value, High Effort (Schedule):
- [File]: [Why high value] - [X hours]

Low Value, Low Effort (Do If Time):
- [File]: [Why low value] - [X hours]

Low Value, High Effort (Consider Archiving):
- [File]: [Why low value] - [X hours]

Prioritize: High value first, low effort first within value tier
```

---

**Marking Pattern:**

Clear notation for each category:

**Accurate Entry Marking:**
```
Add to top of section:

> **Reviewed:** [Date] - Confirmed accurate
> **Reviewer:** [Name]
> **Next review:** [Date + 3 months]

Keep content unchanged.
Adds confidence to readers.
Tracks currency.
```

**Minor Update Flagging:**
```
Add to section:

> **UPDATE NEEDED** (flagged [date])
> - [ ] Update file path: src/old/ → src/new/
> - [ ] Refresh example with current code
> - [ ] Update version number: v1.2 → v1.5
> **Estimated effort:** 10 minutes
> **Priority:** Medium

Content remains, flags what needs fixing.
Clear actionable items.
Effort estimated for planning.
```

**Major Update Marking:**
```
Add to section:

> **MAJOR UPDATE NEEDED** (flagged [date])
> **Issue:** Architecture changed from monolith to microservices
> **Scope:** Complete rewrite required
> **Estimated effort:** 2 hours
> **Priority:** High
> **Owner:** [Assign to team member]
> **Target completion:** [Date]

Original content preserved until rewrite.
Scope clarified.
Ownership assigned.
```

**Obsolete Entry Handling:**
```
Replace section with:

> **OBSOLETE** (marked [date])
> **Reason:** [Technology removed / Feature deleted / Approach abandoned]
> **Removed:** [When the change happened]
> **Replacement:** [See new approach in X] OR [No replacement needed]
> **Original content archived:** memory-bank/archived/[year]/[topic]/
> **Retirement notice:** [Link to archived RETIRED.md]

Original content moved to archive.
Context preserved for history.
Readers not misled by obsolete info.
```

**Uncertain Entry Flagging:**
```
Add to section:

> **VALIDATION NEEDED** (flagged [date])
> **Uncertainty:** Can't determine if this is current or obsolete
> **Validation:** [Specific question to answer]
> **Ask:** [Team member name]
> **Priority:** [High/Medium/Low]

Content remains with uncertainty noted.
Clear what needs validation.
Assigned for follow-up.
```

**Phased Recovery Plan Pattern:**

Break work into manageable phases:

**Recovery Plan Template:**
```
Memory Bank Recovery Plan
Project: $0
Triage completed: [Date]
Total effort: [X hours]

Phase 1: Quick Wins (Target: Week 1)

- Establish stewardship practices
- Implement update triggers
- Monitor currency

Success Metrics:
- [%] entries accurate
- [%] files reviewed
- [X] obsolete entries archived
- Team confidence: Target 8/10
```

---

**Validation Pattern:**

Resolve uncertain entries:

**Uncertainty Resolution Process:**
```
For each uncertain entry:

1. Identify validation method:
   □ Check current code
   □ Review recent commits
   □ Ask team member
   □ Test implementation
   □ Check production behavior

2. Ask specific question:
   "Is [this approach] still current?"
   "Does [this file] still exist at [path]?"
   "Do we still use [this pattern]?"

3. Get definitive answer:
   - Yes, current → Mark accurate
   - Yes, but... → Flag minor updates
   - No, changed to... → Flag major updates or mark obsolete
   - No, removed → Mark obsolete

4. Recategorize based on answer:
   Move from uncertain to appropriate category

5. Document validation:
   "Validated [date] with [person/method]: [finding]"

Target: Zero uncertain entries after validation phase
```

---

**Preservation Pattern:**

Maintain content during triage:

**Triage Preservation Principles:**
```
CRITICAL: During triage, DO NOT delete or rewrite content.

Triage is assessment, not repair.

DO during triage:
✓ Mark entries with review dates
✓ Flag updates needed
✓ Note obsolete status
✓ Estimate effort
✓ Preserve all original content

DON'T during triage:
✗ Rewrite sections
✗ Delete obsolete entries
✗ Update file paths
✗ Fix examples
✗ Consolidate duplicates

Separation of concerns:
- Triage = Assessment
- Recovery = Repair

Assess completely before repairing anything.
Prevents premature decisions.
Enables informed prioritization.
```

**Triage Report Pattern:**

Document assessment results:

**Triage Report Template:**
```

<instructions>
CRITICAL: Triage is honest assessment, not wishful thinking.

NEVER triage by:
- Marking everything as "minor updates" (avoiding hard truths)
- Deleting content during assessment (premature action)
- Skipping effort estimation (unrealistic planning)
- Guessing accuracy without validation (false confidence)
- Ignoring obsolete entries (pollution persists)

DO NOT:
- Rewrite anything during triage
- Delete obsolete entries yet
- Fix minor issues during assessment
- Rush through validation
- Underestimate recovery effort
- Skip documenting uncertainty

ALWAYS:
- Compare documentation to actual codebase
- Categorize every entry honestly
- Estimate effort realistically
- Mark clearly and preserve content
- Validate uncertain entries
- Create detailed triage report
- Plan phased recovery

REPEAT: Triage is assessment before repair. Mark everything, delete nothing, estimate realistically, plan recovery.
</instructions>

<examples>
✅ GOOD Triage (honest, systematic, actionable):

**Pattern demonstrates:**
- Honest assessment of staleness
- Systematic categorization
- Realistic effort estimates
- Clear marking and preservation
- Actionable recovery plan

**Why this works:**
- Honest assessment of each entry
- Realistic effort estimates
- Clear categorization
- Content preserved during triage
- Actionable recovery plan
- Prioritized by value and effort
- Team confidence this is achievable

---

❌ BAD Triage (superficial, overly optimistic):

**Anti-pattern characteristics:**
- Quick scan without deep review
- Overly optimistic categorization
- No effort estimates
- Vague recommendations

**Bad triage:**
```
Looked through memory bank. Seems mostly fine.

A few things need updating but nothing major.

Should be quick to fix.

(No specific categorization)
(No effort estimates)
(No validation of accuracy)
(No detailed plan)
```

**Why this fails:**
```
What happened:

Week 1: Started "fixing a few things"
- Realized payment architecture completely wrong
- Found 6 obsolete sections not noticed
- Discovered 12 file paths broken
- "Quick fix" became multi-day effort

Week 2: Still finding problems
- More obsolete content discovered
- Major rewrites needed
- Didn't estimate effort properly
- Team frustrated with scope creep

Result:
- "Quick fix" took 2 weeks
- Team lost confidence
- Still not sure if complete
- Wished for proper triage first

Impact: 2 weeks wasted on unplanned work
Could have been prevented: 2 hour triage upfront
```

**Lesson:**
```
Proper triage upfront saves massive time later.

2 hours of honest assessment prevents 2 weeks
of scope creep and frustration.

Be pessimistic in triage, realistic in recovery.
Under-promise, over-deliver.
```
