---

<task>
Validate test coverage for $0 in $1 to ensure comprehensive testing meets Gate 1: Test Integrity requirements.

Test coverage validation ensures your tests actually verify behavior. Minimum thresholds: 80% branch coverage overall, 100% coverage of CRITICAL business logic, 100% of error paths. Coverage is necessary but NOT sufficient—you must also validate test quality.

Follow this process:

1. **Run coverage analysis:**
   - Generate branch coverage report (NOT just line coverage)
   - Identify uncovered branches
   - Locate untested error paths

2. **Validate coverage thresholds:**
   - Overall: ≥ 80% branch coverage (REQUIRED)
   - Critical business logic: 100% branch coverage (REQUIRED)
   - Error paths: 100% coverage (REQUIRED)
   - Constellation integration points: 100% coverage (REQUIRED)

3. **Identify coverage gaps:**
   - Find uncovered branches
   - Locate untested error conditions
   - Detect missing edge case tests

4. **Validate test quality:**
   - Tests validate behavior (not just execute code)
   - Tests use realistic data
   - Tests are independent and deterministic
   - Tests serve as documentation

5. **Generate coverage report:**
   - Document coverage percentages
   - List any justified exclusions
   - Identify areas needing more tests
</task>

<context>
Component to validate:
$0

**Standard Construction Folder Structure:**
This prompt reads from:
- Test files for $0
- Code generation plan from `construction/design/code-generation-plan-*.md`
- Gap analysis from `construction/requirements/gap-analysis.md`

And outputs coverage report to `construction/quality/coverage-report-$0.md`
</context>

<thinking>
Before validating coverage, analyze:
1. What is the minimum coverage threshold? (80% branch overall, 100% critical)
2. What code is CRITICAL business logic? (requires 100% coverage)
3. What are ALL error paths? (must be 100% covered)
4. What integration points exist? (must be 100% covered)
5. Are there justified exclusions? (generated code, third-party)
</thinking>

<instructions>
CRITICAL: Coverage thresholds are MINIMUM requirements. 80% branch coverage overall, 100% for CRITICAL logic and error paths.

NEVER validate coverage that:
- Uses line coverage instead of branch coverage (branch REQUIRED)
- Skips critical business logic (100% REQUIRED)
- Skips error paths (100% REQUIRED)
- Allows flaky tests (tests MUST be deterministic)
- Counts trivial tests that don't validate behavior
- Excludes code without justification

DO NOT:
- Accept <80% branch coverage (FAIL the gate)
- Accept <100% critical logic coverage (FAIL the gate)
- Accept <100% error path coverage (FAIL the gate)
- Count tests that just execute code without assertions
- Skip test quality assessment (coverage alone is not enough)
- Allow coverage to drop below thresholds

ALWAYS:
- Use branch coverage (NOT line coverage)
- Require 100% coverage of CRITICAL business logic
- Require 100% coverage of error paths
- Require 100% coverage of constellation integration points
- Identify ALL uncovered branches
- Document justified exclusions with reasons
- Assess test quality (not just coverage percentage)
- FAIL the gate if thresholds not met

REPEAT: 80% branch coverage overall, 100% CRITICAL logic, 100% error paths. Coverage is NECESSARY but NOT SUFFICIENT—validate test quality too.

---

## Coverage Gaps

### Uncovered Branches
1. **File:** `src/middleware/rateLimitMiddleware.ts` **Line:** 78
   - **Branch:** `if (queueDepth > 500) { logWarning() }`
   - **Why Uncovered:** Warning branch for high queue depth (not critical)
   - **Test Needed:** Add test: `it('logs warning when queue depth exceeds 500')`
   - **Priority:** Low (warning only, not critical path)

2. **File:** `src/middleware/rateLimitMiddleware.ts` **Line:** 92
   - **Branch:** `if (process.env.DEBUG) { logDebug() }`
   - **Why Uncovered:** Debug logging (excluded from coverage requirements)
   - **Test Needed:** None (excluded)
   - **Priority:** N/A (justified exclusion)

**Total uncovered:** 2 branches (8%)
- 1 non-critical warning (acceptable)
- 1 debug logging (excluded)

---

## Justified Exclusions

### Excluded from Coverage
1. **Code:** Debug logging statements
   - **Reason:** Development-only code, not executed in production
   - **Justification:** Debug code behind `process.env.DEBUG` flag. Does not affect production behavior. Coverage of debug logging provides minimal value.
   - **Lines:** 92-95

---

## Test Quality Assessment

### Test Quality Metrics
- ✅ Tests validate behavior (uses specific assertions, not toBeTruthy)
- ✅ Tests use realistic data from constellation (Redis keys, timestamps, amounts)
- ✅ Tests are independent (each test has own setup)
- ✅ Tests are deterministic (no flaky tests, no random data)
- ✅ Tests serve as documentation (descriptive names with Given/When/Then)
- ✅ Critical logic has 100% branch coverage
- ✅ Error paths have 100% coverage

### Test Quality Score: 10/10 ✅

**Strengths:**
- Excellent use of AAA pattern
- Realistic test data shaped by constellation
- All tests have descriptive names
- Good coverage of edge cases (boundary conditions)
- No flaky tests detected

**No quality issues found.**

---

❌ BAD coverage report (vague, not actionable):

```markdown
# Coverage Report

Coverage: 85%

Status: Pass

Some lines not covered. Add more tests.
```

**Why this is BAD:**
- No breakdown by category (critical vs non-critical)
- Line coverage not branch coverage
- Doesn't identify WHAT is uncovered
- No test quality assessment
- Not actionable (doesn't say what tests needed)
- Missing critical logic validation
- Missing error path validation
- No constellation integration validation

---

✅ GOOD coverage failure report (clear blockers):

```markdown
# Test Coverage Report: PaymentProcessor

## Coverage Summary

**Overall Branch Coverage:** 72% ❌ (Target: ≥ 80%)
**Critical Logic Coverage:** 85% ❌ (Target: 100%)
**Error Path Coverage:** 60% ❌ (Target: 100%)
**Integration Point Coverage:** 100% ✅ (Target: 100%)

**Status:** ❌ FAIL

---

## Coverage by Category

### Critical Business Logic (MUST be 100%)

**File:** `src/services/paymentProcessor.ts`
**Function:** `processPayment` (CRITICAL)
**Coverage:** 85% ❌
**Status:** ❌ FAIL - BLOCKER

**Uncovered Branches:**
1. Line 156: `if (amount > 10000) { requireManagerApproval() }`
   - **CRITICAL:** Large amount approval path NOT TESTED
   - **Risk:** High-value payments might bypass approval
   - **Test Needed:** `it('requires manager approval for amounts over $10000')`
   - **Priority:** CRITICAL - MUST FIX

2. Line 178: `if (fraudScore > 0.8) { blockPayment() }`
   - **CRITICAL:** Fraud detection path NOT TESTED
   - **Risk:** Fraudulent payments might not be blocked
   - **Test Needed:** `it('blocks payments with high fraud scores')`
   - **Priority:** CRITICAL - MUST FIX

**Action Required:** ADD TESTS for both critical branches before passing gate.

---

### Error Paths (MUST be 100%)

**Error Condition:** Payment gateway timeout
**Coverage:** 0% ❌
**Status:** ❌ FAIL - BLOCKER

**Uncovered Error Paths:**
- Payment gateway network timeout (30s)
- Payment gateway 503 service unavailable
- Payment gateway invalid response format

**Test Needed:**
- `it('handles payment gateway timeout with retry')`
- `it('handles 503 errors from payment gateway')`
- `it('handles invalid response from payment gateway')`

**Action Required:** ADD ERROR PATH TESTS before passing gate.

## Gate 1: Test Integrity Status

### Requirements
- ❌ ≥ 80% overall branch coverage (achieved: 72%) - **BLOCKER**
- ❌ 100% critical business logic coverage (achieved: 85%) - **BLOCKER**
- ❌ 100% error path coverage (achieved: 60%) - **BLOCKER**
- ✅ 100% constellation integration coverage (achieved: 100%)
- ✅ All tests pass (147/147 passing)
- ✅ No flaky tests
- ✅ Tests are self-documenting

**Gate Status:** ❌ FAIL

**BLOCKERS:**
1. CRITICAL: Large payment approval path untested (Line 156)
2. CRITICAL: Fraud detection path untested (Line 178)
3. CRITICAL: Payment gateway error paths untested
4. Overall coverage below 80% threshold

**Required Actions:**
1. Add test for manager approval on large payments
2. Add test for fraud score blocking
3. Add tests for all payment gateway error scenarios
4. Re-run coverage and validate ≥80% overall

**DO NOT proceed to next gate until all blockers resolved.**
```

**Why this is GOOD:**
