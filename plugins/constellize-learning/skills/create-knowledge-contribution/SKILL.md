<task>
Create knowledge contribution by $0 packaging $1 for team sharing—writing clear problem statement and context, documenting solution approach with rationale, creating reusable patterns or templates, adding to appropriate memory bank sections, linking to related knowledge—enabling knowledge transfer from individual to team and preventing knowledge loss when engineer moves or context is forgotten.

Knowledge contribution transforms personal insight into team asset. This differs from personal learning journey:
- Personal learning journey: Individual documents their own growth
- Knowledge contribution: Individual packages insight for team to use

Both are complementary. Personal learning can lead to knowledge contribution when engineer identifies learnings worth sharing systematically.

Knowledge contributions serve multiple purposes:
1. Knowledge transfer: Others learn and apply this knowledge
2. Knowledge preservation: Insight doesn't disappear if engineer unavailable
3. Quality consistency: Team applies same pattern rather than reimplementing
4. Onboarding: New team members learn from these contributions
5. Career growth: Engineer recognized as subject matter expert

Connects to Chapter 8 theme of individual contributions strengthening team capability.
</context>

<thinking>
Before creating knowledge contribution:
1. What insight am I sharing?
2. What problem does this solve?
3. Why is this valuable for team?
4. What's the clearest way to explain this?
5. How can team apply this?
6. What templates or patterns would help?
7. How does this connect to existing knowledge?

# Knowledge Contribution: Circuit Breaker Threshold Tuning

Contributed by: Alex Chen
Date: 2026-01-29
Audience: Engineers implementing resilience patterns
Status: Ready for team

## Summary

**What is this knowledge:**
Circuit breaker threshold tuning is an empirical process, not a theoretical exercise. Thresholds must be validated against actual traffic patterns and failure modes using load testing with failure injection.

**Why it matters:**
Poor thresholds cause two problems: Too sensitive (opens unnecessarily, rejects valid requests), too lenient (doesn't protect from cascading failures). Good thresholds require testing, not guessing.

**When to use:**
Whenever implementing circuit breakers for external API calls or service dependencies.

---

## Part 1: Problem and Context

### Problem We're Solving

**The problem:**
When implementing circuit breaker patterns, engineers often guess at thresholds (error rate %, request count to evaluate, timeout duration). These guesses often don't match production traffic patterns, causing either false circuit opens (too sensitive) or inability to protect from cascading failures (too lenient).

**Why important:**
- Circuit breaker is critical for resilience
- Poor thresholds undermine resilience goals
- This problem appears in every circuit breaker implementation

### Context

Engineers often reference circuit breaker textbooks or libraries for example thresholds, then apply those to their system without validation. But thresholds depend on:
- Baseline error rate of dependency (1% vs 10% normal)
- Acceptable latency for requests
- Recovery speed needed when circuit opens
- Cost of rejecting requests vs. cascading failures

All of these are system-specific, requiring empirical validation.

---

## Part 2: Solution Approach

### Detailed Approach

**Step 1: Establish baseline error rate**
- What: Measure what normal error rate looks like for this dependency
- Why: Thresholds should only trigger on abnormal error rates, not baseline noise
- How:
  1. Monitor dependency for 1-2 weeks under normal load
  2. Measure error rate distribution (p50, p95, p99)
  3. Document baseline
- Example: Stripe API has 1-2% baseline error rate under normal conditions (transient timeouts, etc.)

**Step 2: Identify failure scenarios**
- What: Define what failure modes you want to protect against
- Why: Different failure modes need different threshold configurations
- How:
  1. Transient failures: Individual requests fail, but dependency recovers quickly
  2. Cascading failures: Dependency degraded, most requests fail
  3. Sustained outages: Dependency completely down, 100% failure
- Configure thresholds for each scenario

**Step 3: Design load test with failure injection**
- What: Create load test that simulates realistic traffic + failure scenarios
- Why: Validate thresholds against realistic conditions
- How:
  1. Generate traffic at expected production load (e.g., 500 req/sec)
  2. Inject failures matching expected failure modes
  3. Measure circuit breaker behavior at each threshold configuration
- Example: Inject 30% Stripe API failure rate (simulating Stripe degradation)

**Step 4: Empirically validate thresholds**
- What: Run load tests with different threshold configurations
- Why: Find thresholds that:
  - Don't false-open during normal operation
  - Do open quickly when dependency truly degraded
  - Allow recovery when dependency recovers
- How:
  1. Start with conservative thresholds (high error rate required to open)
  2. Run load test, observe circuit behavior
  3. If false opens: Increase threshold
  4. If doesn't protect: Decrease threshold
  5. Repeat until balanced

**Step 5: Implement and monitor**
- What: Deploy circuit breaker with validated thresholds
- Why: Monitor to ensure real production behaves like load test
- How:
  1. Deploy with full monitoring of circuit state
  2. Track: How often circuit opens, how long open, how quickly recovers
  3. Compare actual behavior to load test predictions
  4. Adjust thresholds if real production differs from test

### Rationale

This empirical approach works because:
- Thresholds are system-specific (can't use generic values)
- Load testing reveals edge cases theory misses
- Validated thresholds have evidence supporting them
- Monitoring validates assumptions hold in production

Alternative approaches don't work as well:
- Theory-based tuning: Misses real failure modes and traffic patterns
- Borrowing from other systems: May not match your dependency's behavior
- Trial-and-error in production: Risks cascading failures while tuning

Trade-offs:
- Requires investment in load testing infrastructure
- Benefit: Resilience patterns actually work

---

## Part 3: Reusable Patterns and Templates

### Load Test Pattern for Circuit Breaker Validation

**Pattern:**
```
Create load test that:
1. Generates traffic matching expected production load
2. Injects failures matching known failure modes
3. Monitors circuit breaker state (open/closed/half-open)
4. Validates circuit behavior against expectations

Load test configuration:
{
  traffic: {
    requestsPerSecond: 500,
    duration: 5 minutes,
    rampUp: 1 minute
  },
  failureScenarios: [
    { name: "transient", errorRate: 10%, duration: 30s },
    { name: "degraded", errorRate: 50%, duration: 60s },
    { name: "outage", errorRate: 100%, duration: 30s }
  ],
  circuitBreakerConfig: {
    errorThreshold: 50,
    requestCount: 10,
    timeoutMs: 30000
  },
  validation: {
    shouldOpenDuring: ["degraded", "outage"],
    shouldNotOpenDuring: ["transient"],
    recoveryTime: "<10 seconds"
  }
}
```

**How to apply:**
1. Identify your dependency and its baseline error rate
2. Define failure scenarios to protect against
3. Set up load test with failure injection
4. Test different threshold configurations
5. Choose thresholds that balance false-positives and protection

**Common mistakes:**
- Mistake 1: Using textbook thresholds without testing
  - Fix: Always load test with your real traffic patterns
- Mistake 2: Tuning only for happy path (no failure injection)
  - Fix: Include realistic failure scenarios in tests

### Threshold Configuration Template

**When to use:** Starting a new circuit breaker implementation

**Template:**
```
Circuit Breaker Thresholds for [DependencyName]

Dependency baseline error rate: X% (measured over [period])

Configuration:
  Base threshold: [N]% error rate over [M] requests
  Rationale: Allows up to [N]% error rate without opening, protects at [N+10]% error rate

  Fast-fail threshold: [K] consecutive errors
  Rationale: Catches total outages (100% failure) immediately

  Half-open timeout: [T] seconds
  Rationale: Allows [estimated recovery time] for recovery

Expected behavior:
  - During transient failures (baseline +/- 5%): Circuit stays closed
  - During degraded (baseline + 30%): Circuit opens after ~30 seconds
  - During outage (100% error): Circuit opens immediately via fast-fail

Load testing results:
  - False open rate: [X]%
  - Protection effectiveness: [Y]%
```

**How to customize:**
- [Dependency name]: Replace with your dependency
- [N]%: Set based on load testing results
- [T] seconds: Set based on dependency's typical recovery time
