description: Facilitate retrospective focused on organizational knowledge practices and continuous learning improvement
---

<task>
Conduct knowledge-focused retrospective for $1 Sprint $0 by systematically evaluating how well team captured learnings, identified knowledge gaps, shared knowledge across the team, and maintained memory bank documentation—generating action items to improve organizational learning practices.
</task>

<context>
Sprint: $0
Team: $1
Duration: $2
Documentation: $3

Knowledge retrospectives complement traditional retrospectives:
- Traditional retrospective: Team dynamics, process effectiveness, collaboration
- Knowledge retrospective: Learning capture, documentation quality, knowledge transfer

Knowledge retrospectives surface:
1. How well did we capture learnings from this sprint?
2. What knowledge gaps became apparent during implementation?
3. How effectively did we share knowledge across the team?
4. Which memory bank documents need updates?
5. What could we improve about working with knowledge?

Connects to Chapter 8 theme of compound learning.
</context>

<thinking>
Before conducting knowledge retrospective:
1. What knowledge did we generate this sprint?
2. How well did we capture and document it?
3. What gaps became apparent?
4. How effectively did team members share knowledge?
5. Did our memory bank help or hinder progress?
6. What practices should we continue, adjust, or abandon?
</thinking>

## Knowledge Retrospective Structure

```
# Knowledge Retrospective: $1 Sprint $0

Sprint: $0 | Team: $1 | Duration: $2
Date: [YYYY-MM-DD] | Facilitator: [Name] | Participants: [Names]

## Part 1: Knowledge Capture Assessment

### Knowledge Generated This Sprint

1. [Knowledge item]: [Category: Technical/Organizational/Process]
   - How discovered: [Debugging, code review, incident, etc.]
   - Significance: [Why this matters]
   - Capture status: [Well captured / Partially / Not captured]

2. [Knowledge item]: [Category]
   - [Same structure]

### Capture Quality Assessment

For key knowledge items, assess:
- Specificity: [1-5] Was it specific enough to reuse?
- Completeness: [1-5] Did we capture rationale, not just what changed?
- Accessibility: [1-5] Can team easily find this knowledge?
- Actionability: [1-5] Can someone apply this in future work?

If poorly captured: What would have helped? Should we go back and capture it now?

## Meeting Facilitation Guide (60-90 minutes)

**Part 1 (20 min): Knowledge Capture**
- "What significant knowledge did we generate?"
- For each: Was it captured? How well? Where?

**Part 2 (15 min): Knowledge Gaps**
- "What did we wish we had known?"
- Assess severity, discuss how to fill

**Part 3 (15 min): Knowledge Transfer**
- "How well did we share knowledge?"
- Identify stuck knowledge and transfer plans

**Part 4 (10 min): Memory Bank**
- "Did our docs help or hinder?"
- What needs updates?

**Part 5 (15-20 min): Action Items**
- Generate improvements with owners and timelines

</output-format>

<instructions>
CRITICAL: Knowledge retrospective is not a complaint session. Focus on systematizing learning practices and improving organizational learning health.

DO NOT:
- Make it about blame ("You should have documented that")
- Treat knowledge capture as optional
- Skip knowledge transfer discussion (silent killer of organizational learning)
- Create action items without owners and deadlines

ALWAYS:
- Celebrate successful knowledge practices and transfers
- Connect findings to memory bank improvements
- Distinguish one-time issues from systemic patterns
- Assign owners to action items
- Identify compound learning effects
- Assess memory bank effectiveness honestly

REMEMBER: Knowledge retrospectives build organizational learning capability. Each sprint's practices get better when systematically evaluated and improved.

## Example: Sprint 23 Knowledge Retrospective

```
# Knowledge Retrospective: PaymentAPI Team Sprint 23

Sprint: Sprint 23 | Team: PaymentAPI Team | Duration: Jan 15-29, 2026
Date: 2026-01-29 | Facilitator: Morgan Lee | Participants: Alex, Jordan, Morgan, Casey

## Part 1: Knowledge Capture Assessment

### Knowledge Generated

1. Circuit breaker dual-threshold pattern: Technical
   - Discovered: Load testing during implementation
   - Significance: Critical for implementing resilience patterns
   - Status: Well captured (learning doc, systemPatterns.md, load testing guide)

2. Database migrations need N-1 compatibility: Technical + Process
   - Discovered: Challenge when migration broke dev environments
   - Significance: Prevents recurring broken dev environments
   - Status: Partially captured (fix made, pattern could be better documented)

3. Cross-team dependency changes need communication plan: Organizational
   - Discovered: Stripe V3 migration coordination with Checkout team
   - Significance: Prevents late surprises for dependent teams
   - Status: Partially captured (discussed, not systematized)

### Capture Quality: Circuit Breaker Pattern

- Specificity: 5/5 (specific thresholds with rationale)
- Completeness: 4/5 (has rationale, could use more failure examples)
- Accessibility: 4/5 (multiple docs, could have central link)
- Actionability: 5/5 (someone can follow documented approach)

---

## Part 2: Knowledge Gaps

### Gaps Discovered

1. Automated N-1 compatibility detection for migrations
   - Where revealed: Challenge 1 (migration broke dev environments)
   - Impact: Manual code review insufficient, engineers lost ~4 hours
   - Severity: HIGH (recurring risk)
   - Root cause: Tool gap—no automated checks

### Gap Analysis: Automated N-1 Detection

- What needed: Tool to detect migration compatibility issues
- What we did: Added checklist item (manual, can be forgotten)
- How to fill: Research tools, build CI check (Owner: Platform lead, Sprint 24)
- Priority: Urgent (ongoing risk)

---

## Part 3: Knowledge Transfer

### Transfer Events

1. Circuit breaker pattern
   - From: Alex → To: Jordan, Morgan, Casey
   - Method: Pair programming + code review + load testing + docs
   - Effectiveness: 5/5 (all demonstrated understanding in planning)
   - Impact: Future implementations won't require Alex

2. Stripe V3 migration approach
   - From: Jordan → To: Casey, Alex
   - Method: Code review + ADR
   - Effectiveness: 3/5 (can maintain, but deep reasoning stayed with Jordan)
   - Impact: Maintenance distributed, architecture expertise centralized

### Stuck Knowledge

Stripe V3 migration design decisions: With Jordan
- Why stuck: Owned entire migration, others participated but not in design
- Risk: Team can't explain migration reasoning if Jordan unavailable
- Plan: Architecture review session Sprint 24 for Jordan to present approach

---

## Part 4: Memory Bank Effectiveness

### Documents That Helped

1. systemPatterns.md#resilience
   - How: Foundation for circuit breaker implementation
   - Quality: Accurate, comprehensive
   - Impact: Saved ~4 hours research

### Documents That Needed Updates

1. systemPatterns.md#database-migrations
   - Issue: Didn't include N-1 compatibility requirement
   - Impact: Missing pattern didn't help during Challenge 1
   - Update: Add N-1 requirement with examples
   - Priority: HIGH

---

## Part 5: Compound Learning

Database Performance Mastery:
- Sprint 21: 2 days to fix slow query (reactive)
- Sprint 22: 4 hours to fix (applied Sprint 21 approach, 75% faster)
- Sprint 23: 0 issues (prevented via code review + automated tests)
- Acceleration: Moved from reactive to proactive prevention

---

## Part 6: Action Items

### Immediate

1. Distribute Stripe V3 expertise
   - Category: Transfer
   - Owner: Jordan
   - Success: Team can explain migration approach after architecture session

2. Create automated N-1 compatibility detection
   - Category: Gap filling
   - Owner: Platform lead
   - Success: CI check catches compatibility issues

### Process Changes

1. Add knowledge retrospective after sprint retrospective
   - Current: Learning captured separately
   - New: 30-45 min dedicated session
   - Trial: 2 sprints
   - Success: Better awareness of knowledge generated
