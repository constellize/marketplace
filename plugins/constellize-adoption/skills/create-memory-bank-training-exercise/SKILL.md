description: Design hands-on training exercises for memory bank learning
---

<task>
Design hands-on training exercise for learning memory banks using $0 with $2 duration by using real project context (not toy examples), structuring with clear learning objectives, including plan-prompt-proceed pattern practice, providing reflection prompts for learners, creating success criteria and checkpoints—enabling self-paced or facilitated learning that transforms memory bank concepts into real capability.
</task>

<context>
Exercise Context: $0
Learning Objectives: $1
Duration: $2

Hands-on exercises drive learning better than lectures or documentation. By practicing with real project context, learners:
1. See immediate value (not abstract)
2. Build confidence through success
3. Develop practical skills, not theory
4. Create artifacts they'll reference later

Connects to Chapter 9 adoption pattern: Learn by doing, in context, with guidance.

Format: [Self-paced / Facilitated / Pair / Group]

## Learning Objectives

By end of exercise, participants will:
- [Objective 1]: [Specific, measurable outcome]
- [Objective 2]: [Specific, measurable outcome]
- [Objective 3]: [Specific, measurable outcome]

## Exercise Setup (10 minutes)

### Context

Real scenario:
- [Describe actual project context]
- [Why this matters]
- [What participants will accomplish]

### Success Criteria

Participants will succeed when:
- [Criterion 1]: [Observable success indicator]
- [Criterion 2]: [Observable success indicator]
- [Criterion 3]: [Observable success indicator]

### Resources Provided

- [Resource 1]: [What you'll have access to]
- [Resource 2]: [What you'll have access to]
- [Support]: [Who to ask for help]

## Phase 1: Planning With Memory Bank (30 minutes)

### Activity: Create Project Plan

Task: Using memory bank, create detailed plan for [real project task]

Steps:
1. Read memory bank sections:
   - systemPatterns.md: [Sections relevant to task]
   - techContext.md: [Sections relevant to task]
   - [Other relevant sections]

2. Answer planning questions:
   - Question 1: [What design pattern applies?]
   - Question 2: [What technical decisions do we need to make?]
   - Question 3: [What constraints should we consider?]

3. Create implementation plan:
   - [High-level approach]
   - [Key decisions]
   - [Risks/assumptions]

### Reflection Prompts

- What information from memory bank was most helpful?
- What information did you wish was in memory bank?
- How did memory bank inform your planning?

## Phase 2: Prompting With Memory Bank Context (30 minutes)

### Activity: Create AI Prompt Using Plan

Task: Using your plan from Phase 1, create detailed prompt for AI assistance

Steps:
1. Gather context from memory bank:
   - [Architectural patterns relevant to task]
   - [Technical decisions that apply]
   - [Previous solutions to similar problems]

2. Create prompt including:
   - [Clear problem statement]
   - [Context from memory bank]
   - [Specific requirements]
   - [Constraints and considerations]

3. Review prompt:
   - Does prompt include all relevant memory bank context?
   - Would AI assistant understand the problem clearly?
   - Are success criteria explicit?

### Reflection Prompts

- How did including memory bank context improve your prompt?
- What would be different without memory bank?
- How clear is your prompt for AI assistance?

## Phase 3: Proceeding With Implementation (60-90 minutes)

### Activity: Implement With AI Assistance

Task: Use prompt from Phase 2 to implement with AI assistance

Steps:
1. Share prompt with AI (or facilitator acts as AI)
2. Review AI response:
   - Does it follow architectural patterns?
   - Does it match technical context?
   - Are there gaps in understanding?
3. Refine and implement
4. Compare to memory bank patterns:
   - Does implementation match documented patterns?
   - Are there improvements to document?

### Checkpoint

At halfway point:
- [ ] Implementation in progress
- [ ] AI has provided useful guidance
- [ ] Team understands problem context

### Reflection Prompts

- How did memory bank context improve implementation quality?
- What would be different without memory bank?
- What should be added to memory bank based on this implementation?

## Phase 4: Reflecting and Contributing (20 minutes)

### Activity: Reflection and Knowledge Contribution

Task: Reflect on learning and contribute to team memory bank

Steps:
1. Individual reflection:
   - What did I learn about [topic]?
   - What memory bank information was most valuable?
   - What's missing from memory bank?

2. Team share:
   - One key learning per person
   - One suggestion for memory bank improvement

3. Create contribution:
   - What should we add to memory bank based on this exercise?
   - Who will update it?

### Final Reflection Prompts

- What's the value of memory banks for planning and implementation?
- How would you use memory banks in future work?
- What would help memory banks be more useful?

## Success Indicators

Participants demonstrate learning when:
- [Indicator 1]: [Observable evidence]
- [Indicator 2]: [Observable evidence]
- [Indicator 3]: [Observable evidence]

Example indicators:
- Effectively reference multiple memory bank sections in planning
- Create detailed prompt including relevant memory bank context
- Implementation follows documented patterns
- Suggest improvements to memory bank based on exercise

## Facilitation Guide

If facilitator is guiding exercise:

Phase 1 (30 min):
- Ask: "What patterns apply to this task?" (guide to memory bank)
- Watch: Are they finding relevant sections?
- Suggest: If stuck, point to specific memory bank section

Phase 2 (30 min):
- Ask: "What context should AI know?" (guide to complete prompt)
- Watch: Is prompt including relevant memory bank info?
- Suggest: "Remember the memory bank says X, include that in prompt"

Phase 3 (60-90 min):
- Observe: Is team following documented patterns?
- Ask: "Does this match the pattern in memory bank?"
- Support: Help when stuck, but let team solve problems

Phase 4 (20 min):
- Ask: "What did you learn? What should we document?"
- Encourage: Create memory bank issue/PR for improvements
- Celebrate: Acknowledge learning and contributions

## Example: Payment Feature Training Exercise

```markdown
# Training Exercise: Implementing Payment Retry Logic

Context: Team learning to use memory bank while implementing payment retry feature
Learning Objectives:
- Use memory bank to research architectural patterns
- Create detailed implementation plan using pattern guidance
- Write prompt that includes relevant memory bank context
- Implement feature with pattern consistency
- Contribute learnings back to memory bank

Duration: 3 hours (one afternoon)
Format: Facilitated group exercise (4 engineers + 1 facilitator)

---

## Phase 1: Planning (30 minutes)

Team reads memory bank sections:
- systemPatterns.md#resilience: Circuit breaker pattern with thresholds
- systemPatterns.md#error-handling: Retry logic approaches
- techContext.md#resilience4j: Library we use for resilience
- operations/performance/load-testing.md: Validation approach

Planning questions answered:
1. What pattern should we use? (Circuit breaker with exponential backoff)
2. What thresholds match our system? (50% error rate over 10 requests)
3. How should we validate? (Load test with failure injection)

Plan created:
- Use Resilience4j for circuit breaker implementation
- Configure with memory bank-documented thresholds
- Validate with load testing approach from memory bank

Team reflection:
- "Memory bank gave us thresholds, saved research time"
- "Found previous load testing approach we can reuse"
- "Feel confident about thresholds because they're documented and validated"

---

## Phase 2: Prompting (30 minutes)

Prompt created including:
- Clear problem: Implement payment retry with circuit breaker
- Context from memory bank:
  - Resilience4j library configuration
  - Documented thresholds
  - Circuit breaker lifecycle
  - Error handling pattern
- Requirements:
  - 3 retry attempts with exponential backoff
  - Circuit breaker opens at 50% error rate over 10 requests
  - Half-open timeout 30 seconds
- Success criteria:
  - Follows Resilience4j patterns
  - Thresholds match documentation
  - Includes all error handling

Team reflection:
- "This prompt is way better than I would have written without memory bank"
- "AI will understand our system constraints because of context"
- "Expectations are clear because we documented thresholds"

---

## Phase 3: Implementation (60-90 minutes)

AI (or facilitator playing AI) responds with implementation outline.

Team reviews:
- Does it follow circuit breaker pattern from memory bank?
- Are thresholds used correctly?
- Is error handling complete?

Team implements:
- Adjusts AI response where needed
- Compares to documented patterns
- Validates logic matches memory bank documentation

Checkpoint (45 min in): Everyone has working circuit breaker implementation

Team reflection:
- "Implementation matches pattern documentation"
- "Memory bank saved us from inventing our own error handling"
- "All team members implemented similarly because we followed documented pattern"

---

## Phase 4: Reflection and Contribution (20 minutes)

Individual reflection:
- What I learned: Circuit breaker pattern, thresholds are empirical not theoretical
- Memory bank value: Pattern documentation saved time, created consistency
- Missing from memory bank: Common implementation mistakes and how to avoid

Team contributions:
- Alex: "Add section on verifying circuit breaker behavior in tests"
- Jordan: "Document common pitfalls we encountered"
- Morgan: "Create runbook for monitoring circuit breaker state"

Contributions scheduled:
- Alex will add test verification section (this sprint)
- Jordan will document pitfalls (next sprint)
- Morgan will create monitoring runbook (next sprint)

Final reflection:
- Memory bank value demonstrated: Faster planning, better implementation quality, consistent patterns
- How we'd use going forward: Check memory bank for patterns before starting
- Improvements: Keep memory bank updated as we learn more

<instructions>
CRITICAL: Training exercises teach through doing, not explaining.

DO NOT:
- Use toy examples (use real project context)
- Lecture about memory banks (practice with them)
- Make exercise too easy (some productive struggle helps learning)
- Skip reflection (learning amplified through reflection)
- Expect adoption after one exercise (practice builds habit)

ALWAYS:
- Use real project context that matters to participants
- Structure for success (checkpoints, guidance, support)
- Include reflection prompts (amplifies learning)
- Celebrate improvements to memory bank (closes loop)
- Make value explicit (show ROI)
- Provide clear success criteria
- Enable self-paced and facilitated versions

REMEMBER: Best training exercises create "aha!" moments where learners experience real value and think "I want to do this again."
