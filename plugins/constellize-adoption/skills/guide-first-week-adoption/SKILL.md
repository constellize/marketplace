Context: $1
Style: $2

First week is critical. Success here determines whether adoption continues or stalls. First week succeeds when:
1. Early wins build confidence
2. Value is visible (not theoretical)
3. Process feels manageable (not overwhelming)
4. Support is available (not solo)

Connects to Chapter 9 adoption theme: Structured path from curiosity to practice.
</context>

<thinking>
Before first week guidance:
1. What can $0 accomplish in first week?
2. What would be early wins?
3. What would overwhelm?
4. What support is needed?
5. How to measure success?
</thinking>

## Five-Day First Week Path

```
# First Week Adoption Guide: $0

Person/Team: $0
Week: [YYYY-MM-DD through YYYY-MM-DD]
Context: $1
Style: $2

## Five-Day Path: Curiosity to Practice

DAY 1: Create Minimal Memory Bank (1 hour)
DAY 2: Document One Decision (1 hour)
DAY 3-4: Plan-Prompt-Proceed (4-6 hours)
DAY 5: Reflect and Evolve (1 hour)

Total time: 7-9 hours across week

## Day 1: Create Minimal Memory Bank

**Goal:** Build confidence through quick win

**What to do:**
1. Create team memory bank directory
2. Create systemPatterns.md:
   - Add 3-5 key patterns your team uses
   - Keep it minimal (1-2 paragraphs each)
3. Create techContext.md:
   - Add key technologies/versions
   - Keep it minimal (what someone needs to know)

**Time:** ~1 hour
**Success:** You have 2 documents, can share with team

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Created memory-bank/ directory
- [ ] Created systemPatterns.md with 3-5 patterns
- [ ] Created techContext.md with tech decisions
- [ ] Both files have real examples

**Common challenge:** Perfectionism ("This isn't complete")
Response: "Perfect is enemy of done. Start minimal, expand when needed."

## Day 2: Document One Architectural Decision

**Goal:** Experience value of decision documentation

**What to do:**
1. Identify one architectural decision (past or current)
2. Create ADR (Architectural Decision Record):
   - What decision was made?
   - Why was it made?
   - What were alternatives?
   - What are trade-offs?
3. Save as: decisions/adr-001-[decision-name].md

**Time:** ~1 hour
**Success:** You have written one ADR

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Identified specific decision
- [ ] Wrote ADR with context and rationale
- [ ] Included alternatives considered
- [ ] Saved in decisions/ directory

**Why this matters:** Show that preserved reasoning enables confident decisions.

## Days 3-4: Try Plan-Prompt-Proceed

**Goal:** Experience full value of memory bank + AI

**What to do:**
Pick real feature/task to implement. Follow pattern:

**Day 3 (Morning): Planning**
1. Read your memory bank
2. Identify relevant patterns
3. Create implementation plan:
   - Architecture approach
   - Key decisions
   - Known patterns to follow

**Day 3 (Afternoon): Prompting**
1. Create detailed prompt for AI:
   - Problem statement
   - Context from memory bank
   - Specific requirements
   - Success criteria
2. Share with AI assistant

**Day 4: Proceeding**
1. Review AI suggestions
2. Compare to memory bank patterns
3. Implement, checking against patterns
4. Does implementation follow documented patterns?

**Time:** 4-6 hours (normal development work)
**Success:** Feature implemented with memory bank reference

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Planning used memory bank
- [ ] Prompt included memory bank context
- [ ] Implementation followed documented patterns
- [ ] Felt faster/better than without memory bank

**Common challenge:** "This is slowing me down"
Response: "First time slower (learning). Second time faster (pattern reuse)."

## Day 5: Reflect and Evolve

**Goal:** Consolidate learning, plan for future

**What to do:**

**Morning: Individual Reflection (30 min)**
1. What did I learn?
2. What memory bank helped with?
3. What was missing?
4. What should I add?

**Afternoon: Share and Decide (30 min)**
1. Share with team/mentor
2. One key learning
3. One suggestion for memory bank
4. Decide: Continue this practice?

**Documentation:**
- Add reflection to memory-bank/progress.md
- Create issue for memory bank improvements
- Plan next week's adoption steps

**Time:** 1 hour
**Success:** Reflection captured, decision made

**Checkpoint:**
- [ ] Wrote reflection of week's learning
- [ ] Shared one key learning with team
- [ ] Identified one improvement to memory bank
- [ ] Feel ready to continue practice

**Reflection Questions:**
- What surprised you about memory banks?
- What provided most value?
- What would you do differently next time?
- Will you continue this practice?

- Feels manageable (not overwhelming)
- Small success builds confidence

DAY 2: Value Demonstration
- Documented decision with reasoning
- Sees how this helps future decision-makers
- Understands value of preserving context

DAYS 3-4: Pattern Reuse
- Uses memory bank during planning
- AI understands problem through context
- Implementation follows patterns
- Feels faster than without memory bank

DAY 5: Reflection and Commitment
- Captured learning from week
- Identified value from memory banks
- Committed to continuing practice
- Ready for next week

```

## Common First-Week Challenges and Solutions

```
Challenge 1: "Doesn't feel useful yet"
- Expected: Takes 2-3 practices to feel natural
- Solution: Complete full week before deciding
- Perspective: Pattern reuse happens on second use

Challenge 2: "Takes too long to document"
- Expected: First time slower (learning)
- Solution: Keep minimal, iterate
- Perspective: Second time faster (copy pattern, customize)

Challenge 3: "Not sure what to document"
- Expected: Only document what team actually needs
- Solution: Document when you ask a question
- Perspective: If you had to ask, others will too

Challenge 4: "Documentation gets outdated"
- Expected: Yes, needs active curation
- Solution: Make updates part of normal workflow
- Perspective: Imperfect docs better than no docs

Challenge 5: "Team doesn't care"
- Expected: Takes time to see value
- Solution: Show concrete examples of time saved
- Perspective: Early wins convince skeptics

## Example: First Week Adoption

```markdown
# First Week: Solo Developer Adopting Memory Banks

Developer: Jordan
Week: Feb 3-7, 2026
Context: Feature development (new payment webhook handler)

---

## DAY 1 (Monday): Minimal Memory Bank

**What I did:**
1. Created memory-bank/ directory
2. Created systemPatterns.md:
   - Event sourcing pattern
   - Async processing pattern
   - Webhook idempotency pattern
3. Created techContext.md:
   - RabbitMQ configuration
   - Stripe webhook structure
   - Payment state machine

**Time:** 45 minutes

**Felt:** Quick win! Got 2 documents with 3-5 key patterns, felt achievable

**Checkpoint:** ✓ All items completed

---

## DAY 2 (Tuesday): Architecture Decision

**What I did:**
1. Wrote ADR about "Use event-driven processing for payments"
2. Included:
   - Decision: Async event-driven vs. sync
   - Context: Scaling requirements, cascading failure risks
   - Alternatives: Keep monolithic sync, webhook-only
   - Trade-offs: Operational complexity for scalability

**Time:** 1 hour

**Felt:** Understood why system designed this way. Realized preserved reasoning valuable.

**Checkpoint:** ✓ ADR written, captures key reasoning

---

## DAY 3-4 (Wed-Thu): Plan-Prompt-Proceed

**Feature:** Implement webhook handler for Stripe payment confirmations

**Planning (Wednesday Morning):**
1. Read memory bank:
   - Event sourcing pattern (applies!)
   - Webhook idempotency pattern (applies!)
   - Async processing pattern (applies!)
2. Created plan:
   - Use event sourcing for payment transitions
   - Idempotent handler (detect duplicates)
   - Async process, not blocking

**Prompting (Wednesday Afternoon):**
Created prompt including:
- Problem: Implement webhook handler for Stripe
- Context: Event sourcing pattern, idempotency requirement
- Requirements: Handle duplicate webhooks, record payment state
- Success criteria: Idempotent, follows event sourcing

**Proceeding (Thursday):**
1. AI provided webhook implementation outline
2. Checked against patterns: ✓ Used event sourcing, ✓ Idempotent
3. Implemented handler
4. Compared to memory bank patterns: Matched!

**Time:** ~5 hours (normal dev time, included AI collaboration)

**Felt:** Faster planning (found patterns immediately), clearer implementation (knew patterns to follow), fewer design questions

**Checkpoint:** ✓ All phases completed, feature implemented

---

## DAY 5 (Friday): Reflect and Evolve

**Reflection:**
- What I learned: How memory bank guides implementation, importance of idempotency
- Memory bank helped: Found webhook idempotency pattern, applied consistently
- Missing: Common webhook mistakes and recovery strategies
- To add: Webhook error handling patterns

**Share with team:**
"Memory bank made planning faster and implementation more consistent. We should add webhook error handling patterns."

**Added to memory bank:**
- Issue: "Document webhook error scenarios and recovery"
- Plan: Add to systemPatterns.md after this feature complete

**Reflection questions:**
- Surprised by: How much context helps AI (clear prompts, better code)
- Most valuable: Pattern library (didn't have to design from scratch)
- Next time: Start planning by reading memory bank (do this first)
- Continue practice: Yes! Plan to use for next feature

---

## Week Summary

Time invested: 8 hours (distributed across week)

Value experienced:
- Found 3 existing patterns (saved design time)
- Implemented webhook handler faster than usual
- More confident in implementation (following documented patterns)
- Clear improvement for next similar task

Commitment: Continue using for next webhook feature (similar domain)

Next week: Use memory bank for feature 2, expand patterns based on learnings

```

<instructions>
CRITICAL: First week is about experiencing value and building momentum, not mastering everything.

DO NOT:
- Try to create comprehensive memory bank in one week
- Expect perfection (iterate and improve)
- Make it feel like homework (integrate with real work)
- Overwhelm with all possible practices (focus on core pattern)
- Expect team adoption without early wins

ALWAYS:
- Build early wins (Day 1 creates files, Day 2 documents decision)
- Make value visible quickly (Days 3-4 show benefit)
- Reflect on learning (Day 5 cements understanding)
- Support through challenges (anticipate and address)
- Celebrate progress (weekly summary of value)
- Enable continuation (plan for week 2)

REMEMBER: First week succeeds when someone thinks "I want to do this again." Design each day for that moment.
